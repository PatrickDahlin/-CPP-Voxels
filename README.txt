This is a 64-bit only project, 32-bit could be added later if need be

Pre-requisites:
- MinGW-w64
- MinGW /bin folder in PATH

Building:
- Run Compile_Debug.bat
- Run bin/build.exe
- Profit?

Troubleshooting:
- Libraries needed are currently:
	o SDL2
	o SDL2main
	o glew32 (You'll probably need to build it yourself if you can't find binaries online)
