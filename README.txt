This is a 64-bit only project, 32-bit could be added later if need be

Pre-requisites:
- MinGW-w64
- MinGW /bin folder in PATH

Building:
- Run Compile_Debug.bat
- Run bin/build.exe
- Profit?
- Libraries needed are currently:
	o SDL2 2.0.7
	o glew 2.1.0 (You'll probably need to build it yourself if you can't find binaries online)
	o glm 0.9.8.5 (headers only, no lib)
